                <img class="image" src="UNDER GROUND CAVE ( PART 1 ).JPG">
                <img class="image" src="UNDER GROUND CAVE ( PART 2 ).JPG">
                <p class="description">
                A trip to the subterranean river national park is absolutely worth the effort if you're visiting Palawan. It's an otherworldly experience as you paddle through the dark. The clicking of bats and the echoing drips of water are the only sounds you hear.<br><br>
                Most tours will take you 4 km (2.5 miles) along the river. Some tours with special permits organised in advance can explore all 8.2 kilometres (5 miles). That far into the cave, boats can no longer pass and visitors have to swim between the rock walls.<br><br>
                There are a lot of beautiful beaches in the Philippines, particularly in Puerto Princesa. The best part is they’re within reach by land travel from the Underground River.</p>
          
                <p class="activity-title">SABANG BEACH</p>
                <img class="image" src="SABANG BEACH.JPG">
                <p class="activity-desc">
                The eye catching Sabang Beach is sandwiched between towering mountain ranges and the blue waters. It's known to be a picnic spot for Underground River tourists. You can spend your break time (or more) here, getting a tan with the sound of the waves as your background music.<br><br>
                On the other hand, Nagtabon Beach serves as a good spot for tourists who prefers a more peaceful and relaxing escape. The coast is lined up with palm trees and dons a long stretch of white sand.</p>
    
                <p class="activity-title">MONKEY TRAIL</p>
                <img class="image" src="MONKEY _ JUNGLE TRAIL .JPG">
                <p class="activity-desc">
                After your underground river tour, you can opt to go back to Sabang by foot over the 5 kilometer trail, otherwise known as the Monkey Trail or Jungle Trail. The off the beaten path has a steep climb that goes through overgrown forest and karst limestones. The limestone cliffs are definitely the highlight of this trek.<br><br>
                As you go through the trail, you will spot wild long-tailed macaques, an Asian monkey. Hence, the name. If you're lucky, you can also spot endemic species of monitor lizards.</p>

                <p class="transpo">To go to Puerto Princesa's Underground River, you have to travel to Puerto Princesa via land, sea, or air. Once you're in Puerto Princesa, the capital of Palawan, you have to travel to Sabang. It's a small village north of the capital. Here are some ways you can get to Sabang from Puerto Princesa.</p>
                <p class="transpo-desc">
                BY JEEPNEY / BUS : From the Puerto Princesa, head to San Jose Terminal, which is located in the San Jose New Market. From the terminal, you'll see jeepneys and non-air conditioned buses en route to Sabang Port.
                    Their scheduled departure times are 7:00 AM, 9:00 AM, 12:00 NN, and 2:00 PM. They won't leave until all seats are filled. Travel time ranges from around two to three hours, including stopovers. 
                <br><br>
                BY VAN : There are also vans servicing the Puerto Princesa to Sabang route. If you choose this mode of transportation, you can reach Sabang in two hours or less. Larger tour groups can opt to rent vans or tour packages that offer round trip transfers from Puerto Princesa to Sabang Port.
                    From Sabang Wharf, you'll board a small boat to get you to Sabang Beach, which is the entry point to the cave.

                Before traveling to Boracay, a printed voucher from your accredited Boracay hotels and resorts is required. You will be denied entry to the island if you don’t have a voucher from your resort or hotel.<br><br>
                This is part of the new rules that the local government and tourism office is implementing since the island opened to the public after the 2018 rehabilitation program.<br><br>
                Since White Beach is the top tourist spot and the main area for accommodations, restaurants, and activities in Boracay, getting here will be easy once you arrive on the island. Read our guide on how to get to Boracay via Caticlan Airport ( Godofredo P. Ramos Airport ) and Kalibo Airport.<br><br>
                Once you're in the Caticlan Airport or Kalibo Airport, you have to travel to Caticlan Jetty Port, the main jump-off point to Boracay. From there, you will ride a boat going to Boracay Island. Then you will travel by land to get to the famous Boracay beach.<br><br>
                VIA CATICLAN AIRPORT : This is the closest airport going to Boracay's White Beach. However, it's not located on the island itself. From Caticlan Airport, take a 10-15 minute tricycle ride going to Caticlan Jetty Port.<br><br>
                VIA KALIBO AIRPORT : This airport is farther from Caticlan Jetty Port but is preferred by some travelers since the airfare is cheaper than flying to Caticlan Airport. From Kalibo, you can either ride a bus or a van going to Caticlan Jetty Port. Travel time is around 2 hours.</p>
