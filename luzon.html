           <p class="main-title">1. FORT SANTIAGO ( Intramuros, Manila )</p>
           <p class="description">Fort Santiago was a fortress built in the late 1500s by the Spanish government during the colonization of Manila, as part of Intramuros. It served as a storage for ammunition, and converted into a prison cell for activists and the political resistance. One of the most famous names imprisoned here was Philippines’ National Hero Dr. Jose Rizal before his public execution. Fort Santiago Intramuros was also used during the World War II for formidable purposes—the Japanese kept soldiers and political prisoners in the dungeons to torture and execute.</p>

           <p class="description">Mayon Volcano is both a stunner and a killer—renowned for its beauty as it is feared for its destructiveness. Admired for its majestic beauty, Mayon Volcano Natural Park, a famous landmark in the Philippines, never fails to attract travelers across the world. The country’s most active volcano is named after a mythological fairy. Its symmetry and perfect cone shape draw attention across the world but what lies beyond its beauty is its deadly nature: an enormous chamber, churning with molten rock and toxic gas that could blow anytime. It has erupted over 51 times in the past four centuries, the most destructive of which is in 1814. Nevertheless, it has developed a culture of resiliency among the inhabitants of its vicinity, who always rebuilt their towns and cultivated their fields after each destructive eruption.

These have taken the center stage in tourism ads and are always a regular backdrop of many souvenir photos. Because of its magnificence, it has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995. Since then, the world has noticed and never stopped talking about the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras. Located at the foot of the Cordillera mountain ranges in the northern island of Luzon, this destination will definitely take your breath away as you get lost by the astounding view of these rice paddies. </p>

               <p class="activity-title">b. Trekking Mount Amuyao</p>
               <p class="activity-desc">Mt. Amuyao is the country’s 10th highest mountain and an important physical and cultural landmark in Mountain Province. Together with a traverse of Mt. Ugo and Mt. Napulauan, a traverse of Mt. Amuyao is one of the great hiking trails of the Cordilleras. Of the three, it is considered the most challenging, taking the hike from the mountainous town of Barlig, Mountain Province to the summit of Amuyao, then off to a lengthy but well-maintained trail to the scenic villages of Pat-yay and Cambulo and finally to Batad, home of the amphitheatre-like rice terraces that is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The entire trip takes 3-4 days – a real challenge – but the cultural and natural wonders seen in the trek make it a worthwhile expedition.
               </p>

               <img class="mount" src="3.b Mount Amuyao.jpeg" alt="mount">
 
               <p class="activity-what">What To Expect?</p>
               <p class="activity-expect">I. Barlig to Mt. Amuyao summit (5-6 hours; 4.1 km SE): Evenly steep, but the trails are comfortable and reasonably wide. There are no thorny plants or noxious fauna or flora, so you would only have to prepare for the cold. The trail would only be hazardous when muddy – it gets slippery when wet so it’s preferrable to climb Amuyao during the dry half of the year (November-early May) even as one still has to possibility of rain. Since the trails are very friendly, night trekking is a possibility to make sure you reach the bunkhouses at the summit on Day 1. Landmarks at the Barlig trail include the Barlig Viewpoint where you can catch a glimpse of Amuyao’s summit as well as the town beneath.<br>
                   II. Summit to Pat-yay (4-5 hours; 6.1 km SE): First you’ll walk through a ridge facing south. To the left are the mountains of the central Cordilleras – Mt. Pulag is flanked by Mt. Tabayoc; closer to Amuyao are Ifugao’s Mt. Napulauan. To the right is Cagayan Valley and the faraway mountains are that of the Northern Sierra Madre. This trail is very beautiful especially during the summer months when the pink flowers (Melastoma sp.) are in full bloom and the pines and other evergreens rise majestically beside the clouds. After this breathtaking scene, you would descent into the mossy forest. Although it is not as grand as the lush montane forests of Napulauan, the trek is still pleasant, with the trails remaining clean and without trees or shrubs to obstruct you. The descent is steep, though – this is a given throughout the traverse trail. In Tagalog, “Basagan ng tuhod” could be an apt description. That’s why one has to leave Mt. Amuyao’s summit early in the morning to make trekking more relaxed. Midway is cemented shed with a nearby water source. Less than an hour before Pat-yay, the forest will give way into a grassy, level area and you’ll encounter a stream. The entrance to Pat-yay is worthy of pictures, as its terraces come into view; with traditional Ifugao huts giving accent to the bucolic atmosphere. Hopefully, you would arrive at Pat-yay by lunchtime, take a one hour break and prepare to resume trekking.</p>

Even before the Spaniards came, Vigan was already a trading port. Chinese traders sailing from the South China Sea usually came to Isla de Vigan (Island of Vigan) by the Mestizo River that surrounded the island. They used to trade with the local settlers golds, beeswax, and other mountain products.</p>

Aside from the fact that abel is liberally used within this resort, from its tablecloths and towels to the curtains and mosquito nets, the resort’s gift shop carries some beautiful examples of inabel patterns. These are sold by the yard, alongside other Ilocano artifacts and social-realist paintings by the Salingpusa art collective.<br>

               <p class="activity-desc">Pagburnayan or jar-making workshops represent the Ilocos region’s rich history. In Vigan, the Pagburnayan Jar Factory is one of the few remaining jar factories that have stood the test of time. The term pagburnayan came from the root word “burnay” or clay pot, which shows how deeply rooted in pottery Vigan is.  In this tour, you’ll get to learn about the art of making jars, which came from Chinese traders who chose to establish their families in Vigan by living among the Ilocandians during the colonial times. Fermented bagoong, homemade vinegars, and artisanal wines are aged in these jars. By joining the tour, you’ll have a first-hand experience of turning clay into earthenware jars using traditional tools. First, a stone wheel is used to shape the clay and cook it to its durable form in-ground kilns. The kilns are fired up to extremely high temperatures for the jars to come out very strong. You can also add designs or patterns to take your pottery-making experience to the next level.</p>

               <p class="activity-what">What To Expect?</p>
               <p class="activity-expect">I. The process of making a burnay jar starts off by combining locally-sourced clay with a type of fine sand called anay. . The two are mixed on a circular pit trampled over by a carabao. They say that this is one of the factors why these jars are much more robust than ordinary ones. To demonstrate, they even threw one at the ground, it didn’t break.<br>
                   II. After the compound has been properly mixed, they then proceed on breaking and kneading it in smaller portions—taking out small stones and what-nots along the way. The size depends on the product they’re making, the bigger it is, the larger the portion of course. These are then queued for the spinner to mold.<br>
                   III. And this is where the fun begins. It takes two individuals to form a burnay jar. A glob of clay is placed on a platform with a manually-pedaled rotating disk. The first guy spins the base with his foot while another starts to form the jar with his hands. It looks easy, but it takes real craft to make a well-formed pottery.</p>

Famously known with its frequently strong waves that are massive enough to give life to people who would like to ride the waves. As such, Sabang Beach of Baler is the birthplace of surfing in the country. From posh resorts to serene home-stays and beach-fronts, this beach gets you stoked! Sabang Beach may not be a pristine beach if white sand is what you dig. But its beauty emanates as being called the sunrise beach of Aurora province where sunrise and waves are equally as astounding to complement each other to bring forth an amazing surfing experience.</p>
